│  You've been experiencing fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Because of your history of heart disease and diabetes, here are a few things we need to check:                                                            │
│                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  │
│  *   **Possible Worsening Heart Condition:** Your fatigue and shortness of breath could mean that your heart disease is getting worse. We need to check this out quickly to make sure your heart is working well.                │
│  *   **Diabetes Control:** Fatigue can also be a sign that your diabetes isn't fully controlled. We need to check your blood sugar levels to make sure your diabetes is well-managed.                                            │
│  *   **Anemia:** Sometimes, fatigue can be caused by a low blood count (anemia). We'll run some tests to see if this is the cause.                                                                                               │

│  *   **Metformin (500 mg twice a day):** This medicine helps lower your blood sugar levels. It makes your body more sensitive to insulin and reduces the amount of sugar your liver releases.                                    │
│  *   **Atorvastatin (20 mg once a day):** This is a statin medicine that helps lower your cholesterol. Lowering your cholesterol helps prevent heart attacks and strokes, especially since you have heart disease and diabetes.  │
│  *   **Aspirin (81 mg once a day):** This is a low-dose aspirin that helps prevent blood clots. It's important for people with heart disease because it reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes.                           │
