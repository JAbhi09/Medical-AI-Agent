│  Based on the patient's symptoms of severe sore throat and painful swallowing, the top three possible diagnoses are acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess/cellulitis, and epiglottitis. While no medications      │
│  were identified in the provided text, several red flags require immediate attention, including difficulty breathing/dyspnea, severe pain disproportionate to exam findings, trismus, and dehydration. Further evaluation        │
│  should include a thorough history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests such as a rapid strep test, monospot test, lateral neck x-ray or CT scan, and CBC with differential. Management will depend on the final          │
│  diagnosis and may include antibiotics, incision and drainage, or airway management.                                                                                                                                             │
