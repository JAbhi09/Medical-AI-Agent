│  You're having chest pain and shortness of breath, and we're working to figure out the cause. Here are the top things it might be:                                               │
│                                                                                                                                                                                  │
│  1.  **Possible Heart Problem (Acute Coronary Syndrome or ACS):** This means something might be blocking blood flow to your heart. This is serious, and we need to check it      │
│  right away.                                                                                                                                                                     │

│  2.  **Possible Blood Clot in the Lungs (Pulmonary Embolism or PE):** This is when a blood clot travels to your lungs and makes it hard to breathe.                              │
│                                                                                                                                                                                  │
│  3.  **Possible Lung Infection (Pneumonia):** This is an infection in your lungs that can make it hard to breathe and cause chest pain.                                          │
│                                                                                                                                                                                  │
│  **What Will Happen Next?**                                                                                                                                                      │

│  We're going to do some tests to figure out which of these is causing your problems:                                                                                             │
│                                                                                                                                                                                  │
│  *   **EKG (Electrocardiogram):** This test checks the electrical activity of your heart.                                                                                        │
│  *   **Blood Tests (Cardiac Enzymes and D-dimer):** These tests look for signs of heart damage or blood clots.                                                                   │
│  *   **Chest X-ray:** This takes a picture of your lungs to look for infection.                                                                                                  │
│  *   **CT Scan (CT Pulmonary Angiography):** If we suspect a blood clot in your lungs, we'll do this scan to get a better look.                                                  │
│  *   **Angiography:** If the EKG and blood tests suggest a heart problem, you might need this test. It involves putting a thin tube into an artery to look at the blood vessels  │
│  around your heart.                                                                                                                                                              │
│                                                                                                                                                                                  │

│  *   We'll start by putting in an IV (a small tube in your vein) so we can give you medications and fluids if needed.                                                            │
│  *   We'll put you on a heart monitor to keep track of your heart rate and rhythm.                                                                                               │
│  *   We may give you oxygen to help you breathe easier.                                                                                                                          │
│  *   It is important to tell the doctor all the medications you are taking.                                                                                                      │
