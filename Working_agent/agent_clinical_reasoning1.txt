│  Based on the 45-year-old male patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, the top three possible diagnoses are Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), Pulmonary Embolism  │
│  (PE), and Pneumonia. ACS is a high-probability diagnosis that requires immediate evaluation via ECG and cardiac enzyme assessment, potentially leading to angiography. PE       │
│  should be considered, especially if the chest pain is pleuritic and there are identifiable risk factors; D-dimer testing and CT pulmonary angiography would be warranted.       │
│  Pneumonia should be ruled out via chest X-ray.                                                                                                                                  │
│                                                                                                                                                                                  │
│  Red flags requiring immediate attention include severe chest pain, sudden onset of shortness of breath, diaphoresis, hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of hypoxia, as well    │
│  as risk factors for PE. Immediate actions include establishing IV access, cardiac monitoring, oxygen administration, obtaining a 12-lead ECG, ordering cardiac enzymes, and     │
│  considering a chest X-ray. A comprehensive medication history is also crucial but cannot be assessed here due to the absence of medication information.                         │
